# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQLite-and-Python
This project contains data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

* `population` - The population as of 2015.
* `population_growth` - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
* `area` - The total land and water area.

You can download the SQLite database, `factbook.db`, [from this GitHub repo](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases) if you want to work with it on your own computer.
